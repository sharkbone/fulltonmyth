<h2>Chapter 1 - Vampire</h2>
<h3>Scene 01</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date of Play:</strong> Saturday, October 21st, 2023</li>
<li><strong>Setup:</strong> Going to visit his mortal family. Chaos roll: 7, no change.</li>

</ul>
<hr />
<p>The sun’s glow still lightened the western sky even though it had set over an hour ago. Jaycob adjusted his sunglasses and looked to the west in annoyance. It was still too bright. The light turned green and he accelerated away, the small engine on his scooter revving to a high note.</p>
<p>The journey to his parent’s home was not a long one. He’d made sure that his domain was close by so he could be on hand should they need him.</p>
<blockquote><p>Does the family have a poor image of him? He is a night owl, so Likely. Roll: 62, Yes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not that they ever needed him. As a Child of the Night, he only visited after the sun had set and they knew that he slept during the day. That and his father’s certainty that he was on some kind of drugs, or dealing drugs, or what-have-you made sure that no one wanted him around.</p>
<p>But <em>he</em> wanted <em>them</em> around. He wanted to be around them. His Embrace had been rough and with everything that came with it…</p>
<p>He switched on a blinker and made the right-hand turn onto the street he grew up on. He passed the Smith’s house, then the James’ house, though neither family still lived there. The neighborhood had gone downhill along with his father’s auto repair business and they hadn’t been able to flee it like their neighbors. </p>
<p>He motored up into the driveway, then switched off the scooter, popping the kickstand and leaping off of it in one smooth motion. He was soon at his parents door and ringing the doorbell.</p>
<blockquote><p>Do they answer? Even odds. Roll: 72, no they don’t. Are they there? Even odds. Roll: 65, no. I bet Jaycob forgot something that the family was doing. An <strong>important</strong> something.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was no answer at the door. He looked over his shoulder at the street where his father’s old SUV was normally parked and saw that it was gone. </p>
<p>“Oh, shit!” he groaned, realizing that he’d completely forgotten. Tonight was his younger sister’s graduation ceremony! The Etiquette class his mother made them all take as children had a full course leading up to a graduation where the student was deemed to be an “adult.” Jaycob had dropped out before getting to that point, but his sister hadn’t. </p>
<p>And she was graduating tonight. Jaycob checked his phone, looking at the time.</p>
<blockquote><p>Does he have time to maybe get there to see the graduation? Somewhat Likely. Roll: 06, Exceptional Yes!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, he could make it, he realized! He rushed back to his moped and hopped on. He had to get there on time.</p>
<blockquote><p>Make it a Dexterity + Drive roll to get there. Because I got an Exceptional Yes on the “is there time to arrive” question, I won’t bump the difficulty up. However, I don’t have Drive, so that does bump it up one. Roll: 1 success!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After running a couple red lights, cutting through more than one parking lot, and revving his moped for all it was worth, he pulled up in front of the small School of Etiquette. He zoomed up to the front of the parking area, cutting the engine off before he was fully stopped. He let the moped fall over and was off and running towards the entrance. He made it in just as the small orchestra announced the presentation of the graduates.</p>
<p>He moved quietly and smoothly over to where he spotted his parents. His father’s eyes narrowed when he saw him, and his mother gave him a sour smile. </p>
<p>“Did you forget?” she asked him quietly as he sat next to her. </p>
<p>He responded with a curt nod. “Yep. Sorry.”</p>
<p>She eyed him up and down, taking in the ripped jeans, leather jacket and sunglasses he was still wearing. She turned away without further comment.</p>
<p>He ripped the glasses off his face. “Sorry,” he offered again in a quiet voice.</p>
<blockquote><p>Does anything interesting happen during the presentation? Somewhat Likely. Roll: 22, Yes. I don’t know what it might be, so let’s roll on the Event chart: Change / Reality. Interesting. Since this isn’t the Matrix, I don’t think things will shift completely. But, <strong>his</strong> reality needs to shift completely. And his reality is that he’s keeping both worlds separate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One after the other, the graduates are called forward and presented, the ceremony marking their growth from child to adult. It’s really boring, but Jaycob smiles and waves at his sister as she comes out. Everyone laughs because it’s so adorable.</p>
<p>Then, something catches his eye. A face that he almost recognizes. His gaze whips back to where he <em>thought</em> he saw it and…</p>
<blockquote><p>Rolling Perception + Alertness. Roll: 2 successes. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes! There it was, the face! The face of Ming Ping. She smiled at him, then glanced meaningfully over at his sister, then waggled her eyebrows. </p>
<p>Jaycob knew fear in that moment. What was she doing here? And, what did she plan to do?</p>
<blockquote><p>Is Ming Ping an enemy of Jaycob? Somewhat Likely. Roll: 64, Yes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Making eye contact, he nodded towards the exit. She raised an eyebrow.</p>
<blockquote><p>Rolling Appearance + Expression to convince her to go outside with me. Roll: 2 successes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jaycob nodded towards the exit again. This time Ming Ping smiled demurely and stood, making her way there. Jaycob turned to his mother and whispered, “Sorry, mom, I have to leave. Something’s come up. But give Jessica my congratulations!”</p>
<p>Without waiting for her, he stood and left.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ending the scene there. Talking with Ming Ping will be a whole new scene. That was chaotic so chaos goes up to 6. Adding Ming Ping and my sister Jessica to the Characters list. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Scene 02 </h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date of Play:</strong> Sunday, October 22nd, 2023</li>
<li><strong>Setup:</strong> Confronting Ming Ping in front of the School of Etiquette. Chaos roll: 8, no change.</li>

</ul>
<hr />
<p>Jaycob followed Ming Ping out of the school building and found her standing in the shadow of a large tree.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?” he demanded in a hash hiss.</p>
<blockquote><p>What is she doing here? Does she have family as well? Or does she have some kind of vested interest in the graduates? Very Unlikely odds. Roll: 24, Yes, she has family!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“The same thing as you, I imagine,” she said in a purr. “Watching family graduate. Though,” she says thoughtfully, “I imagine the distance between me and my family is much greater.”</p>
<p>That made Jaycob pause. Ming Ping was much older than he, vampirically speaking. So, if she <em>did</em> have family in the school, they were… descendants, he supposed.</p>
<p>“I will admit, I was surprised to see someone of your… lineage here.” She smiled at him, and it was not friendly. </p>
<p>Yes. He was Brujah, traditionally against pomp and circumstance, yet here he was at a school of Etiquette. </p>
<blockquote><p>I’m betting she is Toreador. Likely odds. Roll: 09, Exceptional Yes. She’s high up in the Toreador power structure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He offered her a shrug. “My mom made us all attend the school.”</p>
<p>Ming Ping laughed softly. “My my, you <em>are</em> young!” Jaycob realized that he’d given away information that he might have wanted to keep hidden.</p>
<p>Not that he would have been able to keep it hidden very long. He felt a weight settle on his shoulders. He had to keep them safe, his family safe. </p>
<p>“Can I trust you to keep my secret?” he asked, knowing full well that he couldn’t.</p>
<p>Ming Ping’s eyebrow quirked up. “Can you, my young friend?”</p>
<p>He sighed. “What is it you want?”</p>
<p>She gave him a once over, pursing her lips in thought. “Honestly, I don’t know what you can offer me,” she admitted. “But, I’m willing to receive a boon from you.” He lips quirked up again. “You never know when it might be useful to have someone such as you on my side.”</p>
<blockquote><p>Now Jaycob owes Ming Ping a Minor Boon for keeping his secret. Hooray for the Jyhad!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jaycob nodded quickly. “Fine. You know how to get a hold of me, I assume?”</p>
<p>Her smile turned impish. “Oh, yes. With a sire like yours, we all keep tabs on you.” </p>
<p>That was a revelation that Jaycob didn’t like. While he had assumed that was the case, having it confirmed for him was not pleasant. He nodded to her, and then she turned and walked away. </p>
<p>Jaycob stared after her, fear bubbling inside him. Not fear for himself, but for his family. He had to keep them safe.</p>
<blockquote><p>End of this scene. Chaos bumps up to 7. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Scene 03</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date of play:</strong> Sunday, October 22nd, 2023</li>
<li><strong>Setup:</strong> Calling on my ally. She’s a club promoter, and one of the best in the business. Fernanda Figueres. Chaos roll: 5, Altered scene. Was planning on meeting her alone about Ming Ping, but I think she’s gotten to Fernanda first.</li>

</ul>
<hr />
<p>Jaycob’s scooter buzzed up to Fernanda’s office. It was small, but not because Fernanda was unsuccessful, but because that’s all she needed. She was a club promoter, and one of the best in the business. One word from her would make or break a club.</p>
<p>A car was parked in front of the business, a nice one. So, she was with a client. He walked up to the door. It was a sliding glass door and it stood open. Inside he saw Fernanda sitting behind her large desk, laughing at something the man in front of the desk was saying. They heard him walk up and both turned to look at him.</p>
<p>He paused. He recognized the man; he worked for Ming Ping. When he saw Jaycob, he turned to Fernanda and loudly said, “Well, I think that concludes my business here. I’ll get out of your way.” He stood and turned, smiling at Jaycob.</p>
<p>“Yes, it was a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Hamid.” She stood as well and saw him to the open door. Jaycob stepped aside so Hamid could leave, then turned to Fernanda. She watched Hamid walk to his car and get it, then waved to him as he was backing out.</p>
<p>Finally, she turned to Jaycob. “Jaycob! Long time no see!” She stepped back and gestured for him to enter. “Come in, come in!”</p>
<p>Jaycob followed her in and waited for her to sit in her chair before taking the one Hamid had just vacated. “So, what did he want?” he asked. There was a little bit of defensiveness in his voice, and Jaycob hated it.</p>
<p>Fernanda heard it and raised an eyebrow. “He’s a potential new client. Well, his <em>boss</em> is the potential new client, but he was testing the waters. Apparently, she is opening a place that she wants me to promote, and it could be a <em>very</em> lucrative contract.”</p>
<p>Ice water bathed Jaycob’s veins. Ming Ping had gotten to Fernanda first. What did that meant?</p>
<p>It meant she was going to be keeping a <em>very</em> close eye on him.</p>
<p>He gritted his teeth in frustration. Fernanda noticed and asked him what was wrong.</p>
<p>“Hamid’s boss is a…” he paused to find the right word. “A rival of mine, I suppose.”</p>
<p>Fernanda looked surprised. “Really,” she said in a disbelieving tone. “I wouldn’t think you would run in the same circles.”</p>
<blockquote><p>Rolling Charisma + Expression to convince her of the truth of this. Roll: 2 successes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Well, we do,” he said. “Kind of.” He shrugged. “Suffice it to say she’s a powerful woman and I owe her a favor. And, because of that, she’s keeping a very close eye on me.”</p>
<p>Fernanda smiled. “Okay, I can buy that.” She looked thoughtful, then leaned forward. “Do you think that’s why Hamid showed up tonight?” Jaycob nodded.</p>
<p>Fernanda’s smile grew. “Well, you need to start owing powerful people more favors. I could use a lot more contracts like the one they’re offering!”</p>
<p>Jaycob had to smile at that, but he didn’t feel the humor. </p>
<p>“Well,” he said slowly, “if you’re working closely with her, perhaps you can help me keep tabs on her.”</p>
<blockquote><p>Rolling Manipulation + Expression to convince her to do this. Roll: 0 successes. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fernanda started shaking her head before Jaycob had even finished speaking. “No, I won’t spy on her for you,” she said forcefully. “I’m not going to get involved in it.” She shrugged. “I have to look out for myself, you know?”</p>
<p>She must have seen something in Jaycob’s expression, because she amended, “I’ll let you know if I hear anything that could be dangerous for you, but only that.”</p>
<p>Jaycob nodded, “I guess that’s the best I can ask. Thank you.”</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m going to end that scene there. This didn’t go the way Jaycob thought it would, either. Chaos goes up to 8.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Scene 04</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date of play:</strong> Sunday, October 22nd, 2023</li>
<li><strong>Setup:</strong> Heading back to his domain to feed. Chaos roll: 5, altered. I don’t know how to alter this. Let’s roll a random even to get some inspiration. Roll: Abuse / Death. Oh, fun! /s My herd is doing drugs and getting close to dying.</li>

</ul>
<hr />
<p>Jaycob motored up to the driveway of his duplex and hit the garage remote. The door slowly rattled up and he pushed the moped inside. He stepped out of the garage and hit the remote again to close the door before walking to the front door of the other half of the unit.</p>
<p>The lights were on, which was normal for them at this time of night. Music blared and he knocked on the door. There was no answer. He pulled out his key and put it into the lock. It was illegal, of course, for him to enter their home without notifying them in advance, but he had a need. A Hunger. And they would be cool with it.</p>
<p>He turned the key and opened the door. </p>
<blockquote><p>Rolling Perception + Alertness to tell that something is wrong. Roll: 3 successes. Full success!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first thing he noticed was the smell. It smelled of burning plastic. It was heavy in the air. </p>
<p>“Hello?” he called. There was no answer. </p>
<p>He walked quickly into the house, looking for his tenants. There were three of them, roommates, and they were also his herd. They provided him blood and he offered them cheap rent. Not that they were aware that was the deal, but it existed. </p>
<p>He found them, curled up on the floor in the rear-most bedroom. Drug paraphernalia was everywhere, and all three of them were unconscious.</p>
<blockquote><p>Jaycob has no medical training, so wouldn’t know what to do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jaycob quickly pulled out one of their phones and dialed 911. Quickly, he told them the address and that there were three individuals who looked like they were ODing on some kind of drug. He hung up when they asked his name. </p>
<p>He looked down at the three of them, cursing his luck. He couldn’t risk feeding on them when whatever that drug was, was ravaging their systems. Especially when an ambulance was on its way to get them. </p>
<p>He considered for a moment. Did he want to hang around and wait? Probably, yes. Him being here would answer questions, him not being here would raise questions. He ground his teeth and waited.</p>
<p>The ambulance arrived and carted off all three. </p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t know if cops would normally show up for report of OD, but I’ll just make it a Fate Chart question. Even odds. Roll: 69, nice! Yes, they show up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the cops showed up, they had lots of questions for him. He answered them the best he could while being as vague as he could. No, he did not have permission to enter their house. Yes, he was their landlord. He wanted to ask them to turn down the music, then smelled the burning outside. He went in to check and found them.</p>
<blockquote><p>Charisma + Subterfuge, Smooth-talking specialty applies! Roll: 3 successes. Booyah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cops were not there long. After they left, Jaycob went inside his half of the building and went to his bed. There was still an hour or so before sunrise, but he was so very tired. He’d feed the next night.</p>
<blockquote><p>Chaos is just slapping him around. It goes up again to 9. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Scene 05</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date of play:</strong> Saturday, October 28th, 2023</li>
<li><strong>Setup:</strong> Rising the next night and heading to the Rack to feed. Chaos roll: 4, Interrupted. Gratify / Animals. Jaycob is headed to The Rack when he’s assaulted by some gangsters for their own entertainment.</li>

</ul>
<hr />
<blockquote><p>Spending one blood point to rise. I’m down to three; that’s not good. I already know the setup and I’m not writing a novel, so I’m going to jump right into it!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The car bumped into Jaycob’s scooter again, forcing him to fight the small vehicle for control.</p>
<blockquote><p>Rolling Dexterity + Drive to maintain control. I don’t have ranks in Drive, so difficulty is 7. Roll: 0 successes. But no botch!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jaycob turned the scooter just wrong and the front tire bit into the curb. The vehicle crashed to the ground and sent him flying through the air. The ground reached up and smashed into him, then he tumbled and slid across the pavement.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s possible that they’d leave now. But, they are here for their own entertainment, and they’re not through, yet. Drama! More drama! Also, I think Jaycob was going decently fast, 3 dice of lethal damage. Roll: 1. My soak: 2 successes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The car screeched to a halt as Jaycob started to pick himself up off the pavement. He heard car doors open, the chime of the car telling the driver the key was still in the ignition. Footsteps, coming closer.</p>
<p>Jaycob was angry. Very angry. These punks had come out of traffic and bumped into him for no reason. No reason at all!</p>
<p>And, now they were getting closer. So close to him…</p>
<blockquote><p>Self Control roll to avoid flying into a frenzy. This is definitely a Life-threatening Situation, so difficulty 5. I am at a disadvantage because I’m low on blood. Roll: 0 successes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Beast snapped its chains. Jaycob stood in one fluid motion, his fists clenched and ready for a fight.</p>
<blockquote><p>Rolling Initiative. Also need to decide on stats for these gangsters. I’ll just call them 7 dice baddies. Me: 6, Them: 14. They’ll go first.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just as he stood, he found the first gangster already in his face and swinging a fist. Jaycob saw a glint of metal on it as it swung towards his head.</p>
<blockquote><p>To hit: 6 successes. Ouch. Five roll-over plus 4 Strength, +1 for the brass knuckles. Roll: 5 successes. Soak: 0 successes. I’ll take 2 since I halve it. How many of these guys are there? Up to 4 in the vehicle, Roll: 3. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fist connects and the smashing blow snaps his head back. He stumbles with the force of it, right towards the second gangster wielding a metal pipe.</p>
<blockquote><p>To hit: 4 successes. Three roll-over plus 4 Strength +1 pipe. Damage: 4 damage. Soak: 3, one damage halved, rounded down is 0.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pipe makes a dull clang as it slams into his hip bone, then the third guy is there, stepping in with a “This is Sparta” kick.</p>
<blockquote><p>To hit: 5 successes. Damage: 3. Soak: 0. Half, rounded down is 1. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The three rapid-fire blows stagger Jaycob for a second, but his Beast is unchained and raging. He leaps forward towards the first man who punched him. </p>
<blockquote><p>Spending a Willpower. To hit: 4 successes. Damage: 4. His soak: 1. He is Injured.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jaycob’s fist swings through the air and slams into Knuckles’ chest. He stumbles backwards with a woof of air and clutches at his chest.</p>
<blockquote><p>Back on top. Rolling initiative. I will spend Blood with Celerity for an extra action. Me: 11, Them: 8.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jaycob doesn’t let up, and steps closer to his target, his hands reaching out. He’s hungry!</p>
<blockquote><p>Going in for the clinch! I also forgot to apply my wound penalty to my last attack. Strength + Brawl, +1 for Potence. I’ll spend another Willpower for an extra success. Roll: 1 success. I can immediately roll Strength damage. Roll: 1. Soak: 2. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jaycob’s hands grab the gangster’s shirt. It feels smooth under his fingers, but his grip is like iron. He draws the other man in and headbutts him. The gangster turns his head to the side and blunts the force of Jaycob’s attack.</p>
<p>The gangster responds to Jaycob’s attack and tries to smash his own head into Jaycob’s face.</p>
<blockquote><p>Strength damage, Roll: 3. Soak: 1, so I take 1 more bashing. Dang it, I forgot to apply Jaycob’s wound penalty to the <em>last</em> attack as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The impact shakes Jaycob, but his Beast is in charge and doesn’t feel it.</p>
<p>The other two step forward to attack Jaycob, kicking out and swinging a pipe like before.</p>
<blockquote><p>Pipe attack: 5. Damage: 2. Soak: 2. Kick attack: 2. Damage: 3. Soak: 1. I take 1 more bashing. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The attacks smash into Jaycob’s body, but he ignores them. Moving in a flash, Jaycob pulls the held gangster to his, his fangs extended, seeking out the man’s throat and the blood that pumps just below the skin’s surface there.</p>
<blockquote><p>Making a bite attack with my extra action. Dexterity + Brawl + 1, Roll: 0 successes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jaycob’s mouth slams into the gangster’s neck and his teeth gnash against the skin. He gets tangled up in the gangster’s clothing, though, and can’t break the thin membrane separating him from the man’s life blood.</p>
<blockquote><p>That is probably pretty disconcerting. Is this no longer fun? Are they going to try and disengage? I call it a 50/50. Roll: 54, Yes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two free gangsters cry out in disgust at Jaycob’s actions. The pipe-wielding man drops it and rushes back to the car, calling out for his buddies to “leave the crazy guy.” The kicker also retreats, but Knuckles is still held fast. He wrestles with Jaycob, trying to break free of his grip.</p>
<blockquote><p>Resisted Strength + Brawl to break free. Him: 0 successes. Me: 2 successes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gangster’s fight is ineffectual, and Jaycob’s Beast yanks him forward again, looking to feed.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dexterity + Brawl + 1. I’ll send a Willpower, this time. Roll: 4 successes! The Beast is raging, so it will draw all it can in this turn. +3 blood! Do the other two gangsters realize what I’m doing? Unlikely. Roll: 84, Yes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gangster in Jaycob’s arms goes limp as he gives himself into the Kiss. Blood wells up around Jaycob’s mouth as he draws forcefully. The fresh vitae fills his mouth and pours down his throat and his Beast relishes in it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Do the other gangsters try to save their buddy? I’m not even going to roll for it; I think they flee. And I think Jaycob is going to drain this guy dry. That’s going to cause a lot of fun problems, so I’ll roll with it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gangsters in the car scream out in fear, then one slides over to the driver’s seat and slams the door closed. The engine revs and the tires scream as the vehicle peels away.</p>
<p>In Jaycob’s arms, Knuckles thrashes weakly in pleasure. His eyes roll back into his head and his breathing slows, then stops as Jaycob draws his life out through his neck. When the blood no longer flows, Jaycob drops the corpse to the ground, his wild eyes searching for more. More blood, more violence. But, there is nothing. The other gangsters are gone.</p>
<p>Quickly, the Beast returns to its cage, sated. Jaycob stares down at the body on the ground in front of him, horror slowly dawning. Quickly, he looks around to see if there are any witnesses, then he realizes it doesn’t matter. The other two saw him, saw what he did.</p>
<p>He’s in deep trouble.</p>
<blockquote><p>Rolling for degeneration. Conscience: 2 successes. That was incredibly chaotic. I’m adding the feeding witnesses to the threads list. Also, I think this is a wonderful place to close the chapter. Next chapter will be all about trying to clean up this mess. He earns 10xp. </p>
</blockquote>
