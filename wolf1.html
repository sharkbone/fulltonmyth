<h2>Chapter 01 - Werewolf</h2>
<h3>Scene 01</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date of play:</strong> Friday, October 6th, 2023</li>
<li><strong>Setup:</strong> Rolling on the Mythic chart to create a random event: Develop Rumor. Al Hayes is trying to create a rumor that will cause the police to investigate Bedrock Builders, who he&#39;s certain are corrupting the land in their development projects.</li>

</ul>
<hr />
<p>Al walked into the city hall, his t-shirt straining at his biceps and pecs. The tattered fringes of his jeans dragged on the ground as he moved towards a seat and took it. </p>
<blockquote><p>Is the person next to him an influential business-owner? Even odds: 79. No. They are just a concerned community member.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Al nodded to the woman seated next to him. She adjusted her position, obviously a little uncomfortable with him next to her. Al offered her his hand and his best smile. &quot;Name&#39;s Al, how you doing?&quot;</p>
<blockquote><p>Rolling Appearance + Empathy to create a good first impression. My Rage is lower than my Willpower, so I don&#39;t have any penalties. Difficulty 6, Roll: 0. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The woman give him a sour smile and looks disdainfully at his proffered hand. &quot;This meeting is only for community members. You don&#39;t look like you... belong.&quot; Al drops his hand and his own smile hardens. </p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I&#39;m a member of this community all right,&quot; he responds. &quot;But, I thought the people of the community were better than this.&quot; He stares at her for a moment, considering whether he should get up and leave. After a quick glance around, he decides against it.</p>
<p>&quot;Listen,&quot; he starts, keeping his voice low and leaning towards the woman. &quot;I&#39;m just here because of Bedrock Builders and what they&#39;re doing.&quot;</p>
<blockquote><p>Rolling Manipulation + Subterfuge to plant a rumor with this lady. Difficulty 7 because of the previous interaction. Spending a Willpower and rolling: 2 successes. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The woman&#39;s eyes narrow a bit, but she leans towards Al. In a soft, intrigued voice she asks, &quot;What are they doing?&quot;</p>
<p>Al feigns shock and asks, &quot;You mean you haven&#39;t heard?&quot; Without waiting for her to respond he answers, &quot;They&#39;re using shoddy business practices, sub-standard materials and dumping toxic waste underneath the lots they develop.&quot; He shakes his head. &quot;The grass our kids are playing on sits over who knows what kinds of chemicals! <em>Toxic</em> chemicals!&quot;</p>
<p>She leans back, her eyes narrowed. She doesn&#39;t look completely convinced, but Al&#39;s pretty sure he has her hooked. She&#39;ll dig into it and try to find out if there&#39;s some truth in his allegations. </p>
<p>There probably is, he knows, but he doesn&#39;t have any specifics or evidence. If he did, he&#39;d be taking more direct action. The name Bedrock Builders has come up far too often in his nightly investigations into the Wyrm&#39;s activities in this city. </p>
<p>Before he can talk to anyone else, the meeting starts.</p>
<blockquote><p>Does the meeting have anything to do with a Bedrock Builders project? Unlikely. Roll: 36, that&#39;s just outside of a Yes! So, a no.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The meeting opens up and the topic is introduced. It&#39;s a strip mall slated to go in a lot next to one of the main streets. It&#39;s zoned for residential, but the builder has petitioned for the area to be rezoned. </p>
<blockquote><p>Are the people here voting for it? Even odds: No.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The conversation starts and questions are asked of the meeting leaders. Most of the people are against the development, which Al thinks is a good thing. There&#39;s too much commercial property in the city anyway. Human beings just want to build-build-build-build. He knows it&#39;s destroying the natural areas, the clean areas that connect Humans to the world around them. </p>
<p>As if to himself, he mutters, &quot;I wonder if Bedrock Builders is slated to contract on this project.&quot;</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#39;m trying to get the woman next to me to start asking about them and hoping it will lead the conversation into their supposed misdeeds. Manipulation + Subterfuge. Difficulty of 6 because she&#39;s already intrigued. Roll: 2 successes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Let&#39;s find out,&quot; she says before raising her hand and standing to speak.</p>
<blockquote><p>I believe that&#39;s a good end to this scene and Al has accomplished his goal. Chaos will go down to 4.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Scene 02</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date of play:</strong> Friday, October 6th, 2023</li>
<li><strong>Setup:</strong> Sneaking onto a Bedrock Builders job-site to try and find some evidence to support my suspicions and the rumor I started. Chaos is 4, roll to modify: 8, no change.</li>

</ul>
<hr />
<p>Al stares at the job site from across the street. A chain-link fence wraps around the whole empty lot, but through the links the engineering trailer and large equipment brought in for the job are easily seen. This job is still in its early stages, so this would be the time for them to conceal the toxic waste. </p>
<blockquote><p>Does the site have security? Seems very likely. Roll: 23, Yes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A small suv drives slowly around the block, a rotating yellow light flashing on the roof. Al considers his options. He could try and talk to the security officer and convince them somehow that he belonged there. He could shift into lupus and try and sneak across. He could try and sneak over there as a human. He could try and knock out the security guard. He didn&#39;t relish any of those ideas. If he could get in and out without anyone realizing, that would be the best case. After thinking on it for a few more moments, he decides to try to sneak in while in lupus form.</p>
<p>Stepping back, he melts into the shadows of the building behind him. Carefully but quickly, he removes his clothing, letting it fall into a messy pile, then concentrates.</p>
<blockquote><p>Shifting into Lupus form. Rolling Stamina + Primal-Urge at difficulty 6. I need 4 successes to get there in one turn. Roll: 2 successes. Second turn roll: 3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It takes him longer than he wanted, but Al now stands on all fours in wolf-form. The world opens up around him. The moonlight seems brighter to his eyes and the stink of human living spaces fills his nostrils. He notices it and discards it; he&#39;s used to it by now.</p>
<blockquote><p>With the change taking longer than a turn, it&#39;s possible someone noticed, though I don&#39;t think many people are out here. Unlikely odds. Roll: No.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Al steps out of the shadows, now a large wolf with a gray coat dappled with white. He glances around and it doesn&#39;t appear that anyone has spotted him or paid him any attention at all. Now, to get onto the job site.</p>
<blockquote><p>Rolling Dexterity + Stealth. It&#39;s night, so I&#39;ll drop the difficulty by one to a five. Four successes!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wolf-form Al slinks across the lamp-lit road and gets to the chain-link fence. He follows it around, keeping low to the ground, until he reaches the entrance. </p>
<blockquote><p>The entrance is likely chained closed, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;d make sure it closes so much that a wolf can&#39;t slip in. Is there a gap? Even odds: 82, No. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gate is chained closed, and tight. Al sniffs around it, but there is no gap large enough for him to slip through. That seems strange. Perhaps he&#39;s right about the presence of toxic waste. Still, he won&#39;t find that out until he can get past this gate. </p>
<p>He looks up at the fence. It&#39;s just shy of six feet. He can probably jump over it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Strength + Athletics roll. I&#39;m going to put the difficulty at 7. Roll: 2 successes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a short run alongside the fence and a strong leap, he&#39;s over the fence and lands quietly on the other side. Time to snoop around and find the evidence to support his rumor. </p>
<blockquote><p>Rolling Perception + Alertness at a difficulty of 8. If it&#39;s here, it&#39;s likely hidden well. Lupus gives me -2 difficulty to Perception tests, so I&#39;m back at a 6. Roll: 2 successes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Al spends half an hour sniffing around and searching the premises.</p>
<blockquote><p>Does he find anything? Likely odds. Roll: 65, that&#39;s a No.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His nose finds an abandoned lunchbox, some iron fasteners that are already starting to rust and nothing else. There is no toxic waste on the job site. That&#39;s frustrating. Al gnashes his teeth violently in the dark at his frustration. He was sure there was going to be something here.</p>
<p>He looks over to the engineering trailer. If there&#39;s nothing on the job site, maybe there will be something in the trailer. He considers that for a moment before tossing his wolf-head and padding over that way.</p>
<blockquote><p>Are there one or more fomori guarding the trailer? Likely odds. Roll: 99, that&#39;s an Exceptional No!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Al trots quietly over to the side of the trailer where the metal stairs reach up from the dust to the door. He starts in surprise as he realizes that the door is open. It&#39;s only a crack, but it&#39;s open. Cautiously, his nostrils flare as he tries to smell any problems.</p>
<blockquote><p>Perception + Alertness. Difficulty 7 because I&#39;m just going by scent, but -2 for Lupus. One success. Does he smell an explosive trap? Likely odds. Roll: 20, Yes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The acrid scent of explosives fills Al&#39;s nose and he sneezes the burning sensation clear. He glances down at his paws; they&#39;ll be no good against an explosive trap. He needs fingers. The idea of shifting just his paws to hands gives him the creeps, so he concentrates and shifts to the beast-man form.</p>
<blockquote><p>Stamina + Primal Urge to get to Glabro, difficulty 7. I need 3 successes. I&#39;ll spend a Willpower. Two successes plus the Willpower gets me there!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His fur recedes back into his skin and his shape morphs fluidly into that of the beast-man. His heavy jaw clenches as he flexes his fingers and sets to work examining the explosive trap.</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#39;t see anything that deals with explosives, and based on the Technology skill description, I&#39;m going to say an explosives trap is a Crafts roll. So, Dexterity + Crafts to disarm. Difficulty 7, and I have -1 dice because I don&#39;t have any ranks in Crafts. That&#39;s 3 dice at difficulty 7. I don&#39;t like them odds! Spending another Willpower. Two successes, plus the Willpower gets me a full success! Nice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Al&#39;s fingers reach through the gap in the door and he feels around. He feels a taut tripwire. Feeling around, he&#39;s able to find where it&#39;s attached to the door and slip the tripwire off of the nail. Slowly, he pushes open the door. There&#39;s no explosion and he releases the breath he&#39;d been holding. With a grin, he steps through the door. </p>
<p>The cold night air has infiltrated the engineering trailer as well and it raises goosebumps on his naked body. A weak beam of light falls into the trailer through one window.</p>
<p>Before checking anything else, he bends down to examine the explosive. </p>
<blockquote><p>Is it a military claymore? Even odds. Roll: 35, Yes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A curved plastic shape is nailed to the doorframe. Carefully, Al reaches down and tries to pull it free from the wall.</p>
<blockquote><p>Do I want to make this a roll? Eh, it&#39;s an explosive device and if it blows, that would be pretty interesting. Difficulty 6, Dexterity + Crafts. Roll: One success.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The nails hold into the doorframe more stubbornly than Al anticipates. As he keeps trying to work it free, suddenly it pops loose and tumbles to the floor. A sharp crack sound fills the trailer and Al flinches, expecting it to go off, but it doesn&#39;t. Gingerly, he picks it up and examines it. </p>
<p>One of the protrusions sticking up from the top of it has snapped off. What was that, the detonator? He frowns. If he wants to use it in the future, he&#39;s going to need to figure out how to set it off if the detonator broke off.</p>
<p>Absently, he tries to slip the claymore into a pocket, only to realize he doesn&#39;t have any. He shakes his head, feeling foolish, and then moves to a desk and sets it down. Now it&#39;s time to continue his search for evidence. There <em>has</em> to be something here.</p>
<p>Quietly, he pulls the chair out from behind the desk and takes a seat. A keyboard and monitor sit on the desk while a computer tower sits on the floor. He pushes the power button. It takes a few moments, but the login screen pops up asking for a password.</p>
<blockquote><p>Wits + Computers to figure out the password. It might be written on a sticky note somewhere, or be a word visible inside the trailer. Difficulty 8, I think. I&#39;m rolling 3 dice. I&#39;m going to risk it. Roll: 2 successes!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It takes him two tries, but the messy scrawl on a half-hidden sticky note gives him the password. Now, to find the evidence...</p>
<blockquote><p>He&#39;s already in. If it&#39;s here, he&#39;s going to find it. Let&#39;s ask the Fate Chart. Is there evidence here supporting the rumor that Bedrock Builders are disposing of toxic chemicals in their development sites? Very Likely odds. Roll: 40, Yes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Al smiles as he realizes that it&#39;s all here. Directives, plans, emails going back and forth between the site foreman and the headquarters. He makes copies and then opens up the email client. Quickly he types in the email address for a news reporter at the local newspaper, attaches the documents, and sends them on their way.</p>
<p>Quickly, he shuts off the computer and pushes the chair back to where it was. He feels a little sorry for RTincture, the man the email he&#39;d used belonged to. Part of him hoped nothing bad would happen to him, but anyone who knowingly worked for a company with those kinds of practices really deserved what they got. </p>
<p>He started to the door, then stopped, remembering the claymore. He picked it up and then set it on the floor gently, then concentrated to change forms again. </p>
<blockquote><p>Stamina + Primal Urge difficulty 6 to get to lupus. I need 3 successes. Roll: 3 successes, exactly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His bones shift and hair sprouts from his skin. In a matter of seconds, he&#39;s down on all fours again with his senses open before him. Leaning down, he gingerly takes the claymore into his mouth, then moves through the door and down the stairs quietly.</p>
<blockquote><p>Last chance for the security guard to spot me. Dexterity + Stealth difficulty 5 like last time. Roll: 0 successes!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Al makes it most of the way to the chain-link fence before a spotlight clicks on and shines right at him. The light blinds him and he flinches away from it, the claymore falling from his mouth.</p>
<blockquote><p>Rage roll to see if I frenzy! One success. I&#39;m pretty sure that means I&#39;m good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A human voice calls out, &quot;What the--- what is a wolf doing on the property?!&quot;</p>
<p>Another answers, &quot;Don&#39;t matter none. Shoot it!&quot;</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#39;m going to flee. They are going to shoot. Let&#39;s see who gets more successes! Stamina + Athletics v. Dexterity + Firearms. Me: 2, Them: 2. Running is not going to work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Al leaps forward and grabs the claymore he&#39;d dropped, then turns and runs towards the other side of the fence. Shots ring out and bullets dig themselves into the ground around him. As he gets closer to the fence, he realizes it&#39;s much higher here than it was where he got in. This is not going to work.</p>
<p>What to do? He needs to get away, and--- another bullet slams into a rock in front of him and breaks apart, the pieces ricocheting. One slaps him in the chest.</p>
<blockquote><p>Rolling Rage. One success. Still good!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s it! he says to himself. He&#39;s going to teach these two a lesson. Whirling around, he runs right at them. He taps into the Rage inside of him and pulls it out. His form explodes into war-form!</p>
<blockquote><p>Spending a point of Rage to change instantly. Do the two flee? Very likely. Roll: 09. That is an Exceptional Yes!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With one giant hand, Al rushes towards the fence where the two security guards are standing. Both hold pistols up and pointed, but they fall from nerveless fingers as he rushes towards them. With guttural screams, they turn and rush away.</p>
<p>With a giant leap, Al clears the fence and lands next to their truck, a howl of challenge following the two into the dark. As they disappear around a corner, he chuckles to himself and lets his shape mold back to his human body. That was fun, but he&#39;s accomplished his goal, and now it&#39;s time to get out of here.</p>
<p>He hefts the claymore in his hand. It&#39;s going to be fun figuring out what to do with this!</p>
<p>With that, he trots back to where he left his clothes and dresses quickly. Before the two security guards return, he away, heading back to his apartment.</p>
<blockquote><p>Stuff in that scene went my way, so Chaos drops again to 3. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Scene 03</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date of play:</strong> Saturday, October 7th, 2023</li>
<li><strong>Setup:</strong> More focus needs to be put onto Bedrock Builders, so Al will create some kind of tragedy at their HQ to bring emergency vehicles there. He&#39;s sneaking onto the HQ property to plant the claymore he stole from their job site. Chaos is 3. Change roll: 2. Interrupted scene. Roll: 59 - PC Negative, 74 - Divide, 64 - A burden. A wolf pack stops him on the way to the HQ to say they will take care of that part of it.</li>

</ul>
<hr />
<p>Al packs up a backpack with water bottles, rope, a first aid kit, and other items one might need while doing some urban hiking. He puts the claymore he retrieved from the Bedrock Builders job site the other night on the bottom. It is time to hit the BB headquarters.</p>
<p>Sure, he sent the information to that reporter, but more attention is always better. And what better way to draw attention than a loud boom? He smiles to himself as he jerks the zippers closed on the backpack, then walks out the door of his small apartment. </p>
<p>As he steps out of the lobby door and starts to walk on the sidewalk, a group of people step out into the street on the other side and make their way to him. They&#39;re being obvious about it; they want him to see them. A growl builds in the back of his throat. They walk like predators— wolves. He stops and waits for them to reach him.</p>
<blockquote><p>Going to randomly create the alpha of the pack. Even is woman: Male. Name from Everyone Everywhere list: Piroon Chomanand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The man in front of the others flags him down with a waved hand, then offers it to shake. “Al Hayes, I presume?”</p>
<p>Al doesn’t see any other choice but to be pleasant. He shakes the offered hand. “Yep. That’s me. And you are?”</p>
<p>The man’s teeth are white and straight behind full lips. His features are very Asian, but his English is unaccented. “My name is Piroon Chomanand.” His nose wrinkles as he smiles, “But you can call me ‘Roon. Everyone else does,” he gestures back at the four people standing behind him. </p>
<p>Al looks them over for a minute, then nods to each one. “And, what can I do for you this fine morning, ‘Roon?” </p>
<p>‘Roon looks a little uncomfortable, but shakes it off almost immediately. “Al, the Arm of Gaia wants to speak with you.” A sense of foreboding grows inside of Al as he hears those words. Why would the Arm want to speak with <em>him?</em></p>
<p>“Okay…” Al says. “Do you know what about?”</p>
<p>‘Roon shakes his head. “No. But, he also told us to help with your task. You’re going up against Bedrock Builders, yeah?”</p>
<p>Al nods his head and lets the backpack slip off his shoulder. “Yep. I was going drop this little gift off at their HQ this morning. Draw more eyes to them.” </p>
<p>‘Roon takes the backpack and opens it up, sifting through the contents. He jerks his hand back suddenly and looks up at Al. “You were going to…” he lets the question die. His pack crowds around him to see what’s inside the bag. One of them looks at Al with open disgust on their face after seeing the ‘party favor’ at the bottom.</p>
<p>‘Roon shakes his head. “Okay, we’ve got it from here. You go find the Arm.” </p>
<p>With a cold ball of ice in his gut, Al turns and heads the other way. The Arm of Gaia, and the sept, is outside the city limits. Quite a bit outside, actually. If he wants to get there before sundown, he’s going to have to get a ride.</p>
<blockquote><p>Is he able to get a ride? Whether I’m there in the day or night seems like it might be important, so I’ll roll for it. Even odds: 78. That is a No.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Al starts walking towards the sept. It takes him a couple hours to reach the edge of the city, then he sticks out his thumb. No one bites. The sun rises, then the sun sinks back down and sets. By the time he reaches the edge of the woods and makes his way through to the sept proper, the moon is just beginning to come up over the horizon.</p>
<blockquote><p>First time he sees the moon at night. Roll a die for a random phase and it’s Full. I get 4 points back, but only have 1 spent, so I’m full up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He sees the fires and smells meat cooking long before he emerges from the woods. Eyes spot him and follow him as he makes his way into the center of the sept, seeking out the Arm of Gaia. No one stops him; he’s obviously expected.</p>
<blockquote><p>Who is the Arm of Gaia? Everyone Everywhere to the rescue! Daguang. Dag for short. And, this is supposed to be a negative scene. I think he’s going to get in trouble because he still hasn’t joined a pack.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Arm of Gaia, name of Dag, sits in a circle around the largest fire in the sept. He’s eating a taco, but when he sees Al, he waves him over and gestures for him to sit down.</p>
<p>“Want a taco?” he asks around a mouthful of meat and tortilla.</p>
<p>Al is famished, actually. “Yes. More than one if possible.”</p>
<p>Dag smiles and waves someone over with a plate. There are three tacos and they smell amazing. But, before Al can dig in, Dag starts to talk.</p>
<p>“I heard you are trying to take on Bedrock all by yourself,” he says. </p>
<p>Al pauses, then scoops up a taco and shoves the whole thing in his mouth. “Yep,” he says simply.</p>
<p>Dag shakes his head. “Al, you’re a wolf. We all are. We were meant to work together. <em>You</em> were meant to work with a team.”</p>
<p>Al keeps his eyes on his plate and grabs another taco, shoving it home. “So they tell me,” he mutters. “So <em>you</em> tell me about every time you see me.” </p>
<p>Dag sighs in exasperation. This is a conversation they’ve had a lot. “Yes, and it’s always true. You need to find a team to help lighten the load.”</p>
<blockquote><p>Is Dag going to punish Al somehow, or is this just the normal chiding? Likely odds. Roll: 96, that’s an Exceptional No. So, it’s the normal chiding, but somehow more? I think he’s going to try and force a wolf on him to get him to work with someone. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dag turns away and waves to someone else.</p>
<blockquote><p>Let’s randomly create this person. Even is a woman: Odd, man. Everyone Everywhere: Shane Cooper.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A young man walks up quickly. It’s obvious he was waiting just for this signal. “Al, this is Shane Cooper. I want you to work with him for now. If you two decide you can stand each other, you’ll be the foundation of a future pack.”</p>
<blockquote><p>I didn’t know that Al had a thing against working with others, but that kind of grew out of him working alone. So that was a fun discovery! How would he react in this situation? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Al scoops up the last taco from his plate and shoves it in his mouth while looking Shane over. He chews slowly, then swallows, never taking his eyes off of Shane. Once the food is gone, he turns to Dag.</p>
<p>“Do I have a choice in this?” he asks.</p>
<p>Dag smiles. He shakes his head. “No, you do not.”</p>
<p>Al nods curtly and stands. “Well, Shane, if we want to get back to the city before too late, we’d better head out now.”</p>
<p>Shane’s eyes bug out a little. “We’re going to <em>walk?</em>” he almost yells. </p>
<p>Dag just laughs.</p>
<blockquote><p>Well, this scene did not go as expected. Chaos goes up to 4. I also decided that I got 1 Willpower back from the time between the last scene and this one. Now I’m going to have to make a sheet for Shane…</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Scene 04 </h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date of play:</strong> Thursday, October 12th, 2023</li>
<li><strong>Setup:</strong> Al has pretty much been put off the Bedrock Builder’s thread, so I’ll step away from that for now. But, I started the game with laser focus on that. I need another direction to go, so I’ll roll on the event chart. Roll: Inquire Dreams. That doesn’t help a whole lot. Are they prophetic dreams? Even odds: 85, No. My other thought was that it’s Shane’s dreams/goals. So, I’ll have a short scene while they walk back to the city.</li>

</ul>
<hr />
<p>The sun is hot as Al and Shane begin the long walk back to the city. Al sticks his thumb out to hitch-hike, almost absently.</p>
<blockquote><p>Does a car stop? Even odds: 25, Yes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“So, we’re stuck together, huh?” Al says, his voice wry. Shane chuckles nervously.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I suppose so.” He leaves it at that.</p>
<p>“How long since your first change?” Al continues. </p>
<blockquote><p>I have no idea, but I think it’s been a matter of months. I’ll roll a d10. Roll: 3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shane shrugs. “Three months, give or take.” </p>
<p>Al trips up a little, stumbling over a rock in surprise. “Really? That little?” He shakes his head. “I’m surprised.”</p>
<p>Behind them, they can both hear the sound of a vehicle coming down the road, though neither pays attention to it.</p>
<p>Shane shrugs again. “It’s not much, I know. But, I passed all the tests.”</p>
<p>Al opens his mouth to say something else, when the car coming up behind them honks, and veers onto the shoulder as it passes them by.</p>
<p>Al looks at Shane and smiles. “Our ride is here!” He jogs over to the pickup truck and to the driver’s side window. “Thanks for stopping! We just need to get to the city limits.” </p>
<p>The driver gestures into the truck bed. “Hop on in!” Both he and Shane do so.</p>
<p>As the truck starts to accelerate again and merge back onto the road, Al looks at Shane with piercing eyes. “So, Shane…” he trails off. “What is it you’re hoping to get out of working with me?”</p>
<p>Shane shrugs. “What anyone wants,” he says with an eye on the driver through the back cab glass. “I want to join the fight.”</p>
<p>Al nods. That’s pretty standard for a ‘wolf. Everyone is taught that they must pitch in and do their part after their first change. </p>
<blockquote><p>Is the truck driver connected with Pentex in any way? Even odds. Roll: 68. No.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Al lets Shane’s words hang in the air with the wind-noise for a second before continuing, “What else?”</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t know what Shane wants. He’s a Glass Walker. He’s connected to Humanity in a way similar to Al as a Child of Gaia. He wants to make a difference. What, specifically? Hell, I’ll roll on the event chart again! Roll: Increase Misfortune. That’s fun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shane meets Al’s eyes and Al can see the indecision in them. “You really want to know?” Al’s new packmate asks.</p>
<p>Al nods. “Yep. I really do.”</p>
<p>Shane’s lips turn up a little at the corners. “I want to root out every wyrm-tainted corporation, businessperson, and agent and I want to make their lives miserable.”</p>
<p>Al’s brows lift and his lips purse. “Not…” he glances at the driver through the glass, then shrugs, “you know, ending them?”</p>
<p>Shane’s small smile grows and he looks practically impish. “You know how a lot of military weapons are designed to wound soldiers, not kill?” he asks.</p>
<p>Al shrugs. “No, I didn’t.”</p>
<p>Shane shakes his head, indicating that it doesn’t really matter. “Well, they are. If you wound someone, another soldier, maybe two, have to help them back to safety. You take multiple soldiers off the game-board, so to speak.” He shrugs again. “I’m going to do the same.” He sits back, his smile going a little smug.</p>
<p>Al considers that for a moment, considers Shane. That sounds like a good tactic, actually, he decides.</p>
<blockquote><p>Does anything untoward happen as we are getting close to the city limits? Even odds. Roll: 54, No. That feels like the end of the scene. Chaos will drop to 3 again.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Scene 05</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date of play:</strong> Thursday, October 12th, 2023</li>
<li><strong>Setup:</strong> We now have a direction to go. I’ll pick up the next day. They’ll get home and rest after traveling. They’ll head to City Hall and go through building records to find out any other companies in town that are strongly connected with Bedrock Builders to see if they are evil. Chaos roll: 9. No change in the scene.</li>

</ul>
<hr />
<p>Al and Shane turn the corner and walk up to the city government building, records request in hand. In Shane’s hand. Shane had explained to Al how they had to go about it, making a written request for records and, while Al understood, he didn’t like it. He made Shane do all the legwork.</p>
<p>Which, Shane was happy to do, of course. Documents, research, rules and laws, that was all right up his alley. If they continued this kind of approach in their fight against the Wyrm, Shane was a good person to have around, Al admitts.</p>
<p>To himself. Only to himself. He’s not sure he’ll tell Shane that. At least, not yet.</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ll make a roll for Shane to see how much information he can get. Intelligence + Law. They’re public records so I don’t think the difficulty is higher than 6, though I’ll need a full success to get a specific target. Roll: 0. I had two successes, but they were cancelled by 1s! That could have been an automatic success, but I forgot about that rule. Dice were already rolled!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shane goes into the building and Al tags along, but keeps his distance. Shane takes a number and approaches the window when his number is called. He presents the form and waits for the person behind the window to enter the data from his form, look up his request, and get him a copy of the records.</p>
<p>They return it to him almost immediately.</p>
<blockquote><p>Are they returning it because requests are blocked due to an official investigation? Likely odds. Roll: 83, No. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Sorry, this form is not completed correctly.” They then point out to Shane all the areas where he’d made mistakes. </p>
<p>“Oh, I’ll make the changes, do you have a blank form I can use?” he asks.</p>
<p>They shake their head. “No, you’ll have to return later with a correctly completed form.”</p>
<blockquote><p>This sounds like a great time for a Rage roll from Shane! Roll: 1 success. He’s fine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shane’s teeth grind together as he stares the person behind the glass down, but he finally relents and turns to walk away. “No good,” he says to Al. “I messed up the form.”</p>
<p>Al shakes his head. <em>So much for thinking he’s good to have around,</em> he thinks.</p>
<p>“All right.” He takes a breath. “Let’s tackle this problem a different way.”</p>
<blockquote><p>Does Bedrock have someone in the office to watch for information requests? Seems Very Likely. Roll: 24, Yes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They walk away and begin to discuss just what “different way” they’ll use to approach the problem. </p>
<blockquote><p>Rolling Perception + Alertness to spot a tail. Al: 0. Shane: 2. Tail: 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As they walk down the sidewalk, Shane says in a low voice, “Turn right and then look for a place to hide. We have a tail.”</p>
<p>Al nods, taking the few steps needed to reach the indicated corner, then follows Shane into a right turn.</p>
<blockquote><p>Rolling Wits + Stealth to find a spot to hide from the tail, opposed by the tail. Al: 2, Shane: 4, Tail: 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After making the right turn, they both increase their walking speed, looking around for a spot to hide from the tail. Shane spots it first: a small alley across the street. They rush over to it and step into the shadow. </p>
<p>Their tail shows up after another couple heartbeats, head darting this way and that as the person tries to spot Al and Shane. They fail.</p>
<blockquote><p>Does the tail stop there and make a phone call to their boss? Or continue walking and trying to find the ‘wolves? Even odds. Roll: 37, that’s a continue walking!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tail speeds up, almost skipping down the sidewalk as they try to find Al and Shane.</p>
<p>Al grins and looks over at Shane. “I think we found our ‘different way,’ don’t you?”</p>
<p>Shane grins back at him. “Definitely.”</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ll end the scene here. Things were not in their control, so Chaos goes up.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Scene 06</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date of play:</strong> Saturday, October 14th, 2023</li>
<li><strong>Setup:</strong> They are on the tail of their tail and want to corner them and grill them for information. Chaos roll: 7, no change.</li>

</ul>
<hr />
<p>Al and Shane step out of the shadow in which they’d hidden and started after the person who had been tailing them. They try to catch up to the person without <em>looking</em> like they’re trying to catch up to the person. </p>
<blockquote><p>Rolling Appearance + Stealth to not look like we’re following. Al: 2, Shane: 3, Tail: 3. That’s a tie, so we don’t get closer and they don’t spot us. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tail is moving quickly and in their attempts to stay inconspicuous, Al and Shane can’t make any progress in catching them up. </p>
<p>“What if I go around and cut them off while you follow?” suggests Shane. Al gives him a quick, silent nod.</p>
<p>Shane breaks off and turns down a small side street, then starts to run, trying to get ahead of the tail.</p>
<blockquote><p>Shane needs to roll Stamina + Athletics. Roll: 0 successes. The intent was to surprise the tail, so I think that’s where the failure breaks it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Al keeps following the tail, his eyes darting around as he tries to see where Shane will be coming from, when suddenly the tail recoils in place, then turns and runs the other way, perpendicular to their prior direction of travel. Just as Al is about to give chase, he sees Shane sprint out from the direction opposite to the tail’s flight, chasing him.</p>
<p>“Great,” Al groans under his breath, then starts to run after the tail. As soon as he starts running, though, something inside him rejoices. It urges him to run faster and faster! He starts to enjoy himself perhaps a little too much.</p>
<blockquote><p>Gotta catch up to the tail. Strength + Athletics. Al: 3, Shane: 2, Tail: Botch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tail looks over their shoulder and panics as they see two large figures chasing them. They turn quickly as if they are going to try and sprint away, but trip up and tumble to the ground. They cry out as they tumble along the sidewalk, knees and elbows thumping painfully against the concrete.</p>
<p>Al and Shane quickly reach the tail’s sprawled form and bend down to pick them up.</p>
<blockquote><p>I bet people are looking at us. Is anyone recording? Somewhat Likely. Roll: 62, Yes. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A young man stands across the street with his phone in hand a pointed at the two ‘wolves and their prey.</p>
<blockquote><p>Do either of them notice? It’s interesting because if they do, they’ll have to roll Rage. Perception + Alertness. Al: 3, Shane: 2. They both do. Rolling Rage. Al: 4. Shane: 1. Al rages, and his Rage is higher than his Gnosis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something snaps inside of Al and he screams out his anger at being filmed. It’s a problem, one he‘ll have to deal with. In uncontrolled Rage, he shifts, his body exploding outwards into the Crinos war-form. He rushes across the street towards the man filming.</p>
<blockquote><p>Let’s get some initiative going. Al: 12, Shane: 16, Filmer: 11 (4 dice), Tail: 10 (5 dice). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Al shifts and throws himself across the street, Shane shouts at him. “Al, no!” then bursts free of his own clothing in the dire wolf Hisbo form, interposing himself between Al and the unlucky human. He growls and yips at the unthinking monster, trying to draw its focus.</p>
<blockquote><p>Rolling Manipulation + Animal Ken. I have zero dice. I suppose he can’t roll. That’s a wasted action!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Al, still in unseeing frenzy, plows into Shane, claws flying and jaws snapping.</p>
<blockquote><p>Time to roll an attack against my own packmate! Ahhhh! Attack: 0 successes. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Claws slash, teeth flash, but nothing connects with Shane. </p>
<blockquote><p>The Filmer’s turn. He’s a 4 dice npc, which means he’ll attack the monster. Attack: 4. Damage: 2. Soak: 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The man filming stumbles back half a step as Al, then Shane rush out into the street towards him, then he screams his fear and anger and rushes forward, flinging his phone at Al. The device strikes the monster in the face, but bounces off harmlessly. Al levels piercing yellow eyes at him and growls.</p>
<p>While all that is happening, the tail turns and runs, disappearing into the crowd.</p>
<blockquote><p>Roll initiative again. Al: 11, Shane: 10, Filmer: 6.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Al continues to growl at the filmer, but Shane is in his way, blocking him from the target he really wants. That’s OK. He’ll go through him. With his claws, he tries to tear into the dire wolf in front of him.</p>
<blockquote><p>Attack: 2, Damage: 2, Soak: 4. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>His claws hit the dire wolf and tear into the flesh and fur, but it doesn’t slow Shane down at all. He responds with an angry grown and leaps in to sink his teeth into Al’s massive thigh.</p>
<blockquote><p>Attack: 0. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Al is too quick, whipping his leg away from the attacking dire wolf.</p>
<p>The filmer, whose eyes are wild with fear-anger, looks around for another weapon, something he can use to protect himself from this slavering monster.</p>
<blockquote><p>Roll: 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the gutter, he sees the sun glint off of something and rushes over to pick it up. It’s a glass bottle. He grabs it up and smashes the end on the concrete curb, making himself a weapon.</p>
<blockquote><p>Rolling initiative again. Al: 17, Shane: 18, Filmer: 8.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shane looks over his shoulder, his own eyes burning bright yellow in his dire face. A mangled word tears itself from his jaws.</p>
<p>“rrrRRUUuuNN!”</p>
<blockquote><p>Making a roll to intimidate the filmer into fleeing. Difficulty is his Willpower of 4. I have to spend a Willpower point myself to get the word out. Roll: 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Shane is yelling at the filmer, Al lunges in and his jaws flash as they seek out Shane’s throat.</p>
<blockquote><p>Attack: 5, Damage: 9. Holy crap. Soak: 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Al’s jaws close around Shane’s throat and with a horrific pop-tear, his massive head yanks free. Flesh and blood fly from Shane’s body as Al tears his throat out, and Shane collapses to the street.</p>
<blockquote><p>Immediately spending a Rage point to stay in the fight! I roll my current Rage, which is two. I’m going to spend a Willpower for an auto success. Roll: 1. That’s two points healed!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just as quickly as Shane hits the ground, he’s up again, a gurgling howl tearing itself from his throat as the wound closes.</p>
<p>The filmer, terrified by the dire wolf that spoke to him, throws his broken bottle down and flees, his feet pounding down the pavement.</p>
<blockquote><p>The person who initiated the frenzy is gone, so I’ll roll Willpower to escape the frenzy. Roll: 5. Fantastic. But, Shane is also in frenzy. I think he’ll enter a fox frenzy and flee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The enormous crinos form shakes its head and looks down at its bloody claws and the bleeding form in front of it. It opens its maw and whine-growls something, but the figure in front of it doesn’t answer. Instead, it changes into a small wolf or large dog, and rushes away, its pained yips disappearing into the distance.</p>
<p>Al looks around for witnesses and their tail. Witnesses: there are plenty. The tail is gone. He snorts in irritation, Shane’s blood flying free from his nostrils and spraying the concrete in front of him. He scurries towards the ruined piles of their clothing, gathers it all up in a massively clawed hand, and rushes away.</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ll end the scene there. This seems like a good spot to end this chapter, as well. I’ll add the Public Shift to my threads list. The filmer is going to forget this, so I won’t add him as a character. But I <em>will</em> add the tail. That was extremely chaotic. Chaos goes up. And, the characters get XP. I’ll do 10xp to each character after each chapter.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Need to roll a Battle Scar for Shane and figure out Renown for both.</p>
</blockquote>
